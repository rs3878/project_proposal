# PROJECT PROPOSAL

#### PROBLEM:
What would the job market be like when you graduate? This could be the most important and practical question to a 
first-year undergraduate student. Through empirical evidence and time series trend prediction, this could be forecast.

What's more, how do you get to know each industry and their representative large companies? If you are fond of a 
particular industry, what are the largest companies in the industry by number of followers and employees, and how 
selective is each company? Is your dream company hard to get in? Will your dream company stay to be one of the
largest companies in the respective industry?


#### DATA SOURCE:
Linkedin Profiles:
This database tracks and records the number of employees across companies on daily basis and provides real time 
insight into how aggressively a company is growing vs its own plans and within its industry.
 
Here, Thinknum Media looked at the LinkedIn profile data for Vox and Buzzfeed employees, as well as job listings data.
The journalists also looked at company survey data from Glassdoor, and found that the numbers of Vox employees who had
a positive outlook on the future of their company had fallen almost 20%. By combining all these datasets, they found 
that the number of open job listings was falling, the number of people reporting to be employees of the companies had
fallen, and coupled with the findings from the Glassdoor surveys â€“ showed a picture of slowing company growth for 
both Vox and Buzzfeed.


#### DATA:
Date of the information collected, industry, company name, followers on LinkedIn, employees on platform, link.
Many of the companies are missing description and websites, so they can only be used as helper, not primary factors.


#### BACKGROUND:
Almost a third of first-time college students choose a major and then change it at least once within three years, 
and students who started out in mathematics and the natural sciences are likelier than others to switch fields, 
according to federal data.

To many students who are not particularly passionate about certain fields and who have to bear loan due to tuition,
they might be interested in their career paths more than anything else. It would be helpful if they have information to
companies and career choices early. The difficulty of courses should not be the only determinant factor on students' 
choices of their major, as they often end up doing something entirely different after graduation.To be more specific, 
they might decide their major differently if they are more informed about not only the current job market, but also the 
job market when they graduate. 


#### MOTIVATION:
When I was 17, my first course in college is Calculus, which got me really interested and eventually became a 
Mathematics major. At that time, actuarial science was a hit, accounting was popular as well. I naively decided to be 
an actuary, however, at the time I graduate, the job market for actuaries is full. What's more, due to the improvement 
in AI technology, jobs like accountants and actuaries could be largely replaced by computers. Thus, now I look back, I 
would very much appreciate more information on the future of career markets. 


#### GOAL:
This projects aim to make an analysis on the most popular industry in the past few years, and the industries that 
mostly likely to be the most popular in a couple of years. For each industry, predictions about the companies would also
be made. 

If the students are interested in certain industry, they would love to know the top companies in this industry, at the 
same time, they should be informed about the competitiveness of the companies. We can infer the rate using the number 
of employees divided by the number of followers.
